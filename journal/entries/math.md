recently in math i learned about simplifying radicals and radical operations

first i reviewed the names of the parts of a radical

## simplifying perfect square roots 

lets take the equation 4√50 first you have to find the biggest perfect square that can be multiplied to get to get the radicand in this situation its 50 to do this you can go through the cube roots till you find it 

#### table of perfect cubes 
 |square root|perfect square|
 |---------|------------|
 |1        |1           |
 |2        |4           |
 |3        |9           |
 |4        |16          |
 |5        |25          |
 |6        |36          |
 |7        |49          |
 |8        |64          |

in this situation the biggest perfect square would be 25. next you would seperate the radical into 2 the equation would now look like this 4√25√2 next simplify the the perfect square and multiply it with the number not squared the equation is now solved and would look like this 20√2
