		<p> This healthy recipe made with just 2 simple ingredients not only has a great taste but is also easy to make. you may be wondering what it is. well it's an onion with a little extra flavor. I first learned about this recipe when I invented it. I was curious if i could make a simple onion more tasty than it already was. so I went to my cabinets and took out french onion soup base. at that moment a thought came to my mind what if I combined 2 great flavors. an onion and french onion soup base, and that is exactly what I did.
