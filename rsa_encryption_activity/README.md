 ### What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?

 Symmetric encryption is when both sender and receiver have the same key. Asymmetric is when the sender uses the receiver's public key to encrypt it then it is sent to the receiver who has a private key that can decrypt the message. Only the private key can decrypt it. 
 
 ### Explain the steps of the encryption and decryption process

Using asymmetric encryption, the sender uses the receiver's public key to encrypt the message. Then the message is sent to the receiver who uses their private key to decrypt it. Using symmetric encryption, the sender and receiver have an agreed upon key that is used by both parties to encrypt and decrypt messages.  
 
 ###  Why is it important that you never share your secret key?

If you share you secret key then any encrypted message that was sent to you can be decoded by anyone with your key.
