Recently in math I learned about simplifying radicals and radical operations.

First I reviewed the names of the parts of a radical.

# Simplifying Radicals 

## Simplifying Perfect Square Roots 

Lets take the equation  $4\sqrt{50}$  . First you have to find the largest perfect square that can be multiplied to get the radicand. In this situation, the radicand is 50 so you can go through the cube roots untill you find it. 

#### Table of Perfect Cubes 

 |square root|perfect square|
 |---------|------------|
 |1        |1           |
 |2        |4           |
 |3        |9           |
 |4        |16          |
 |5        |25          |
 |6        |36          |
 |7        |49          |
 |8        |64          |

In this situation the biggest perfect square would be 25. Next you would seperate the radical into 2. The eqaution would now would now look like this $4\sqrt{25}\sqrt{2}$. Next simplify the the perfect square and multiply it with the number not squared. The equation is now solved and would look like this.

$$20\sqrt{2}$$

## Perfect Cubes and Other Radicals 

simplifying other racidals is just like simplifying sqaure roots except you divide the radicand by number to the power of the index for example if we have a cube root you use cubes. also if the index is a odd nomber the root can be a negitive number if its even it cant be negitive. If there are variables you can divde the variable by the index.

# Multiplying, Adding and Subtracting 

to multiply add or subtract radicals the radicands must be the same if they are diffrent you could try to simplifying them to try to make them the radicands the same.
# Dividing 

first check if the index is the same if so start simplifying the coefficent then the radicands after that you need to multiply both sides of the multiplication by the bottom radicand then lastly you simplifying.
