# journal post 1

over the last 2 or so weeks i have been learning how to use terminus in web page design in this journal post i will go over some things i have learned 

## tools and their importance

* cd: this tool allows you to navigate between pages without it you could not move through out the terminal. 
* ls: allows you to view where you can go from where you are with out it this tool it would be a lot harder to navigate the terminal. 
* less: this tool alows you to view the files on the computer. 
* rm: this command allows you to remove files you dont need without it you could not delate anything. 
* mv: this tool allows you to move files between directories without it you would not be able to move files. 
* echo <<: this command allows you to edit text files without using vim. 
* vim: vim allows you to easily edit the text in a text file you can leave it by clicking escape the writting :q if you want to save you wright :wq.
* git: you use git to work on your website. to use it you crate or make a edit to a file then you wright git add " the file name"  then git commit -m " a message that describes the change" the git push. once this is done your website will be updated. this tool is importanat because without it you could not update the website.
## how i am feeling so far
so far in webpage design i am feeling a little overwhelmed with the amount of new tools i am learning however i think that i can keep up.
## my addvice
my advice to future students who want to learn is to pay attention in class because if you miss something you can easily fall behind.
