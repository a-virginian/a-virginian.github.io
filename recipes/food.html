		<p>this wonderfull recipe can feed a decnet amount of people and is easy to share. I first learned about htis recipe when I accidentally invented it when cooking rice in a rice cooker. due to my capablity to just stumble apon it, it is evident that it is easy to make. and while i have not done it my self i imagine it would be a great way to prank someone.</p>
