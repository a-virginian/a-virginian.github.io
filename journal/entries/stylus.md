# stylus 

 In web page design class I recently had a assignment where I had to alter the design of a websites css with stylus

At first I was having trubbles figureing out how it works however after a little while I got it.

I decided to change arlington techs website I did this by putting a big red box around a photo in addition i changed the text color to red and the background color to black lastly i changed the font to wingdings 
here is the code and a image:

 body {

        background-color: black;

        font-family: wingdings;
    }

div,h1,p,h2,h3,h4,h5{

    color: red;

    font-family: wingdings;
    
}

.hero {

    border: 18px dotted red;
    
   
}
