the 3 webites i studied was [fahrneyspens.com](https://www.fahrneyspens.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoo_EEZ-cRW4kmkGlQSostKkHGC1PRxoMDplh65qni5MVgWYu872),[shoppennypost.com](https://shoppennypost.com/) and [bertramsinkwell.com](https://www.bertramsinkwell.com/) on fahrneyspens.com i noticed that they had some sales on the homepage so i added one to mine. I also noticed that all 3 websites had places to sign up for a newsletter so i made sure i had one. lastly each of their products had its own page so i made sure all the products on my website also had its own page.

I had a hard start with wordpress however after a while i figured it out. the first problem i had with wordpress was finding a good theme this proved difficult becuase all the good ones cost money. however other than difficulties due to themes costing money i did not have meny problems.one i had figured out how to do something it was easy to do agian.
