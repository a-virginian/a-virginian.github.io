recently in math i learned about simplifying radicals and radical operations

## simplifying perfect square roots 

lets take the equation 4√50 first you have to find the biggest perfect square that can be multiplied to get 50 do do this you can go through the cube roots till you find it 

#### table of perfect cubes 
 |square root|perfect square|
 |---------|------------|
 |1        |1           |
 |2        |4           |
 |3        |9           |
 |4        |16          |
 |5        |25          |
 |6        |36          |
 |7        |49          |
 |8        |64          |

in this situation the biggest perfect square would be 25. next you would seperate the sqaure root the equation would now look like this 4√25√2 next simplify the the perfect square and multiply it with the number not squared the equation is now solved and would look like this 20√2
