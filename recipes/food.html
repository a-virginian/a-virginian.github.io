		<h1> RICE cake </h1>
		<a href="#instructions">jump to recipes</a>
		<p>this wonderful recipe can feed a person  and is easy to share. I first learned about this recipe when I accidentally invented it while cooking rice in a rice cooker. Due to my capability to just stumble apon it, it is evident that it is easy to make. While I have not done it my self I imagine it would be a great way to prank someone by adding frosting.</p>
